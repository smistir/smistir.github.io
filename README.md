# Smistir - Github Pages

I'll be exploring technologies hosted through Github Pages.  In this current repository, I'll be looking at Jekyll and its ability to generate static pages using Markdown language and files.  While Jekyll promotes itself as 'blog aware' I do not think I'll be utilizing the blog aspects.. but, I will be exploring all facets of the technology.

### Objectives:
* Initialize Structure (done)
* Install Theme (done)
* Create a Post (done)
* Create multiple Posts (done)
* Custom Theme
* Explore Markdown
* Enhance Index Page

Expect more objectives to be added later.  While this is not my primary focus, or activity, this will be a side hobby to explore all of the fun features of technology.
