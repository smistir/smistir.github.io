# First Objectives Completed

So far, completed objectives for Initialize Infrastructure, Install Theme, Create a Post, and Create Multiple Posts (this post is serving the last objective).  Also have begun steps to customize
the theme by adding a default.html to the layouts folder.

The repository README file will maintain a list of objectives and completion status.

### Observations

Here are some of the observations that I have had so far:
1. It appears that it is very necessary to get folder names correct - "_layouts"
2. Visual Studio editing can get in the way when extra characters get inserted during push
    - This has been observed in '*.md' as well as '*.html' files
3. It is important to commit to a branch off Master so that irregularities can be caught before introduction to the Master branch
4. Need to discover the appropriate naming convention for posts so that multiple posts can be added in a single day and they be added in FIFO order
    - It appears that they are ordered-by Date (in the file name) then-by Alphabetically on name/title (also in the file name)
